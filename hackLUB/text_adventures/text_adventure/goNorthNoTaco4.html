    <p>You decide that nothing worth eating can be found at this hour.</p>
    <p>You kill time in Central Park, avoid hobos, and watch the sun rise. You finally meet up with your friend and the two of you get in line for tickets.</p>
    <p>The tickets are for a show later tonight, but you're so zonked from staying up all night that you scalp them and go home to sleep.</p>
    <p>Upon waking up, you bike back to 2nd and A and get some dang tacos!!</p>
