    <title>Adventure Game - 57th</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>You roll over to 57th and 7th.</p>
    <p>There, at the corner, is a gleaming beacon of hope. You can almost see the fragrance of the hot breakfast sandwich wafting out into the night air.</p>
    <p>You park your bike, step inside, order a sandwich, and brace yourself as you are met with the beautiful sound of eggs sizzling on the stovetop.</p>
    <p>The man asks if you want bacon, several times. Feeling stingy, you decline, several times. You pay and step out of the store to enjoy your sandwich.</p>
    <p>Unwrapping it is one of the greatest moments of the night, second only to realizing that they have included bacon in your sandwich. Two pieces, in fact.</p>
    <p>You bless this wonderful haven of a deli, walk your bike over to Central Park, and eat the sandwich while the sun rises.</p>
    <p>When your friend finally arrives, you get on line for tickets, take a nap, receive tickets, kill a bunch of hours, and have a great time at the show.</p>
    <p>Then you go home for some much needed sleep.</p>
    <p></p>
