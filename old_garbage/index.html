    <h1>what the fuck is this</h1>
    <p>this is a list of really awful html/css i did back in the days when i wanted to be a professional front-end developer. LMFAO!!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>actually the better part of these were done in the same week cuz someone was like "you should do a thing every day!" uh huh. that worked out</p>
    <p>0 are responsive HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA</p>
    <p>and some feature really great comments HAHAHAHHA</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="layout0/index.html">2013-2014, old website layout that isn't so horrible (relative to what you're about to see)</a></li>
      <li><a href="layout1/index.html">playing around with grids and whatever.</a></li>
      <li><a href="layout2/index.html">playing around with grids, again.</a></li>
      <li><a href="layout3/index.html">note the fantastic header. LMAO!!!!!</a></li>
      <li><a href="layout20140527_1846/index.html">someone was like "you should redesign an existing site!" uh huh</a></li>
      <li><a href="layout20140528_1436/index.html">personal website redesign that is *soo0o0* responsive LOLLLLLL</a></li>
      <li><a href="layout20140529_1705/index.html">i think at this point i recognized that i should keep my gross html/css to myself. thus, personal site redesigns</a></li>
      <li><a href="layout20140530_1639/index.html">skillz</a></li>
      <li><a href="layout20140531_1341/index.html">someone told me that i needed to understand grids so yea grids</a></li>
      <li><a href="layout20140601_1206/index.html">more grids *very* *complex*</a></li>
      <li><a href="layout20140601_1826_threadscopy/index.html">the fontface is not working on this and i don't care to find out why.</a></li>
      <li><a href="layout20140601_2329/index.html">at this point i just gave the fuck up</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>anyway some of these are better than the current look of my personal website, so idk man, forever regressing ova here</p>
    <p>also it makes me angry to look at the html on any of these, cuz i'm like, why didn't i use views and templates. but also no. i don't even fucking want to think about that.</p>
    <p>and this is also why i am fucking NEVER doing frontend again. because fuck browsers and fuck responsiveness and fuck people's opinions on whether or not to use ids</p>
